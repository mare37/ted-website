## Why We Chose Next js For This Project

1 Improved Visibility in Search Engines: Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR), enabling       better indexing by search engines and improving visibility in search results.

2 Enhanced User Experience: Next.js ensures fast loading and high page performance, resulting in an excellent user experience and increased user engagement.
